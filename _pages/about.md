Hi! I am **Dongjin Hwang (황동진)**, a Master's student in the Department of Economics at **Seoul National University**. I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Seoul National University, graduating summa cum laude in 2024.

My primary research interests lie in **microeconomic theory** and **political economy**, but more broadly, I am drawn to economic theory as a whole. I am currently exploring applications across various fields, both within and beyond microeconomics.

We study a model of competitive information design in an oligopoly search market with heterogeneous consumer search costs. A unique class of equilibria—upper-censorship equilibria—emerges under intense competition. In equilibrium, firms balance competitive pressure with local monopoly power granted by search frictions. Notably, firms disclose only partial information even as the number of firms approaches infinity. The maximal informativeness of equilibrium decreases under first-order shifts in the search cost distribution, but varies non-monotonically under mean-preserving spreads. The model converges to the full-disclosure benchmark as search frictions vanish, and to the no-disclosure benchmark as search costs become homogeneous.

**Mismatched Electoral Cycles and Accountability**
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div markdown="1">
<span style="font-size: 80%">
In many presidential systems, the executive and legislative branches serve different term lengths, creating a **mismatch in electoral cycles**. While this institutional feature is common, its implications for electoral accountability remain largely unexplored. This paper studies the effect of such mismatched cycles on the accountability of political bodies, building on the frameworks of Ferejohn (1982) and Persson, Roland, and Tabellini (1997). In each period, the executive and legislature bargain over the allocation of a fixed budget between public goods and political rents. I examine three distinct bargaining protocols, each reflecting a different degree of (de facto) separation of powers. When at least one political actor holds veto power, electoral **mismatch enhances voter welfare by making collusion between political bodies more difficult to sustain**. In short, electoral mismatch can improve accountability, but **only under institutional settings that ensure sufficient separation of powers.**

<span style="font-size: 80%">
    How does partisan alignment between a sender and a receiver affect the partisan content of transmitted information? We conduct an online experiment (1,002 participants) varying messaging nudges (accuracy, directional, no nudge) and receiver partisanship (Pro-Minjoo, Pro-Kookhim, Independent). We find heterogeneous treatment effects depending on sender partisanship and partisan alignment.
