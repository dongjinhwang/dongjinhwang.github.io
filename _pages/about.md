Hi! I am **Dongjin Hwang (황동진)**, a Master's student in the Department of Economics at **Seoul National University (SNU)**. I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Seoul National University in 2024.

My primary research interests lie in **microeconomic theory** and **political economy**, but more broadly, I am drawn to economic theory as a whole. 

You can access my CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lst80760kl2tj38bg24gl/dongjn_hwang_cv.pdf?rlkey=iedv79em8gc9c7775fywt4nkr&st=6zz4id0w&dl=0"

<span style="font-size: 80%">
We study a model of competitive information design in an oligopoly search market with heterogeneous consumer search costs. A unique class of equilibria—upper-censorship equilibria—emerges under intense competition. In equilibrium, firms balance competitive pressure with local monopoly power granted by search frictions. Notably, firms disclose only partial information even as the number of firms approaches infinity. The maximal informativeness of equilibrium decreases under first-order shifts in the search cost distribution, but varies non-monotonically under mean-preserving spreads. The model converges to the full-disclosure benchmark as search frictions vanish, and to the no-disclosure benchmark as search costs become homogeneous. Moreover, we show that the well-known discontinuities of equilibrium with respect to the search cost distribution in price search literature carry over to information competition.

**Split the Calendar to Split the Power: Mismatched Electoral Cycles as a Disciplining Device**. *(Draft available upon request)*

"Split the calender to split the power"

<details id="mismatch-abstract">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
The choice between synchronizing and mismatching electoral cycles—--whether different political bodies should face voters at the same or different times--—is a major and contentious issue in democratic design. This paper asks: under what conditions does this choice benefit voters, and how does it interact with the separation of powers? Building on an otherwise canonical model of electoral accountability, I analyze the effect of (de)synchronization of elections, under different degree of separation of powers. I find that the desirability of mismatched cycles is contingent on the strength of existing institutional checks. When power is concentrated in one political body, mismatched elections act as a disciplining device: the mid-term turnover of the weaker body disrupts collusive agreements that harm voters. Conversely, when formal checks are already strong, this disciplining effect is redundant and election timing is irrelevant. Mismatched cycles thus serve as an informal substitute for formal checks---providing a mechanism to *split the calendar to split the power.*

**Mismatched Electoral Cycles and Corruption: A Cross-Country Evidence**

**Information Transmission in Social Networks: Motivations and Partisanship** (with Hanil Chang, Syngjoo Choi, Abhisheka Dubey, Yong Kyun Kim, Yoonje Lee)


<details id="transmission-experiment-abstract">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
 How is political information transmitted in social domains? How does the motivation to share, as well as, partisanship alignment affect such transmission? We conduct an online experiment (N = 1,002) to test the effect of an accuracy and motivational (partisanship activation) nudge on the information sharing behavior of respondents. While we find that the accuracy nudge has a modest effect on factual information seeking behavior, we find that it has no effect on respondents' sharing behavior. On the other hand, we find that the motivational nudge increases the likelihood of sharing factual information, but only when the receiver's partisanship was aligned with the sender. Moreover, regardless of partisanship alignment, conservative respondents were more likely to share pro-partisan information when they receive the directional nudge. These results suggest a more nuanced effect of nudges on how information is transmitted in social domains.
