Hi! I am **Dongjin Hwang (황동진)**, a Master's student in the Department of Economics at **Seoul National University (SNU)**. I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Seoul National University in 2024.

My primary research interests lie in **applied micro theory** and **political economy**, 
with developing interests in industrial organization and firm dynamics.

You can access my CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fn98d27qe284g952h6l27/dongjin_hwang_cv.pdf?rlkey=pfv1zr4kjvb8m213p4qqe21ao&st=53bbfkuy&dl=0"

<span style="font-size: 80%">
We study a model of competitive information design in an oligopoly search market with heterogeneous consumer search costs. A unique class of equilibria—upper-censorship equilibria—emerges under intense competition. In equilibrium, firms balance competitive pressure with local monopoly power granted by search frictions. Notably, firms disclose only partial information even as the number of firms approaches infinity. The maximal informativeness of equilibrium decreases under first-order shifts in the search cost distribution, but varies non-monotonically under mean-preserving spreads. The model converges to the full-disclosure benchmark as search frictions vanish, and to the no-disclosure benchmark as search costs become homogeneous. Moreover, we show that the well-known discontinuities of equilibrium with respect to the search cost distribution in price search literature carry over to information competition.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
Whether officeholders that jointly shape policy should face voters at the same time (synchronized electoral cycles) or at different times (mismatched electoral cycles) is a contentious choice in democratic design. This paper asks: under what conditions does election (de)synchronization benefit voters, and how does it interact with the policy-making process? Using a canonical electoral accountability framework, we show that the desirability of mismatched cycles depends on the strength of institutional checks across officeholders. When checks are weak and authority is concentrated in a single body, mismatched cycles enhances voter welfare relative to synchronized cycles: midterm
turnover of the weaker body forces the dominant officeholder to renegotiate with a new counterpart, breaking collusive rent-sharing and acting as an institutional “circuit breaker.” By contrast, when
checks are strong and authority is already divided, institutions alone prevent such collusion, rendering election timing irrelevant. In this sense, mismatched cycles function as an informal substitute for formal checks. Our analysis thus highlights a critical spillover in institutional design: changes to term lengths inevitably alter electoral synchronization, thereby reshaping the structure of accountability

**Information Transmission in Social Networks: Motivations and Partisanship** (with Hanil Chang, Syngjoo Choi, Abhisheka Dubey, Yong Kyun Kim, Yoonje Lee)


<details id="transmission-experiment-abstract">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
 How is political information transmitted in social domains? How does the motivation to share, as well as, partisanship alignment affect such transmission? We conduct an online experiment (N = 1,002) to test the effect of an accuracy and motivational (partisanship activation) nudge on the information sharing behavior of respondents. While we find that the accuracy nudge has a modest effect on factual information seeking behavior, we find that it has no effect on respondents' sharing behavior. On the other hand, we find that the motivational nudge increases the likelihood of sharing factual information, but only when the receiver's partisanship was aligned with the sender. Moreover, regardless of partisanship alignment, conservative respondents were more likely to share pro-partisan information when they receive the directional nudge. These results suggest a more nuanced effect of nudges on how information is transmitted in social domains.
