Hi! I am **Dongjin Hwang (황동진)**, a Master's student in the Department of Economics at **Seoul National University**. I received my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Mathematics from Seoul National University in 2024.

My primary research interests lie in **microeconomic theory** and **political economy**, but more broadly, I am drawn to economic theory as a whole. I am currently exploring applications across various fields, both within and beyond microeconomics.

You can access my CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lst80760kl2tj38bg24gl/dongjn_hwang_cv.pdf?rlkey=iedv79em8gc9c7775fywt4nkr&st=6zz4id0w&dl=0"

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
We study a model of competitive information design in an oligopoly search market with heterogeneous consumer search costs. A unique class of equilibria—upper-censorship equilibria—emerges under intense competition. In equilibrium, firms balance competitive pressure with local monopoly power granted by search frictions. Notably, firms disclose only partial information even as the number of firms approaches infinity. The maximal informativeness of equilibrium decreases under first-order shifts in the search cost distribution, but varies non-monotonically under mean-preserving spreads. The model converges to the full-disclosure benchmark as search frictions vanish, and to the no-disclosure benchmark as search costs become homogeneous.

**Mismatched Electoral Cycles as a Disciplining Device**.  
<span style="font-size: 80%">
"Split the calender to split the power"
</span>


<details id="mismatch-abstract">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
In many presidential systems, the executive and legislative branches serve different term lengths, creating a **mismatch in electoral cycles**. I study the effect of such mismatched cycles on the accountability of political bodies, building on the frameworks of Ferejohn (1982) and Persson, Roland, and Tabellini (1997). Each period, the executive and legislature bargain over the allocation of a fixed budget between public goods and political rents. I examine three distinct bargaining protocols, each reflecting a different degree of (de facto) separation of powers. 
Electoral mismatch **enhances voter welfare** when the bargaining power is asymmetric: frequent turnover in the weaker branch forces repeated negotiation, making collusion harder to sustain. In contrast, when bargaining power is symmetric, mismatch has little effect, as institutional separation alone disciplines behavior. **Thus, mismatch can serve as a substitute for formal checks and a safeguard against political capture**.

**Information Transmission in Social Networks: Motivations and Partisanship** (with Han Il Chang, Syngjoo Choi, Abisheka Dubey, Yong Kyun Kim, Yoonje Lee)


<details id="transmission-experiment-abstract">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

<span style="font-size: 80%">
 How does partisan alignment between a sender and a receiver affect the partisan content of transmitted information? We conduct an online experiment (1,002 participants) varying messaging nudges (accuracy, directional, no nudge) and receiver partisanship (liberal, conservative, independent).
